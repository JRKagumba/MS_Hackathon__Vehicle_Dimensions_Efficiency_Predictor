Here's a breakdown of the operations and the significance of each newly engineered feature:\n","\n","### Drop unnecessary columns\n","Columns such as `'MAKE_df1', 'MODEL_df1', 'YEAR_df1', 'Combined_Key_df1', 'DF2_Index', 'MAKE_df2', 'MODEL_df2', 'MYR', 'FILE_YEAR', 'YEAR_df2', 'Combined_Key_df2'` are removed from the dataframe. These columns are considered unnecessary for the analysis, possibly because they contain redundant, irrelevant, or duplicate information.\n","\n","### Interpret 'WDIST' to extract Front and Rear weight distribution\n","The `'WDIST'` column, which contains information about the vehicle's weight distribution between the front and rear, is split into two new columns `'WDF'` and `'WDR'`. These represent the weight distribution in the front and rear of the vehicle, respectively, and are converted to `float` type for numerical operations.\n","\n","### Building new features\n","\n","- **Vehicle Volume (VV):** Calculated as `OL x OW x OH`. This feature represents the overall volume of the vehicle, which might indicate energy consumption efficiency due to factors like air resistance and mass.\n","\n","- **Surface Area (SA):** Calculated as `2 * (OL x OW + OL x OH + OW x OH)`. It approximates the total surface area of the vehicle, which could influence energy consumption through air resistance.\n","\n","- **Aspect Ratio (AR):** The ratio of `OW` to `OH`, providing insights into the vehicle's aerodynamic profile and potentially its energy efficiency.\n","\n","- **Wheelbase to Length Ratio (WBLR):** Represents the ratio of the wheelbase `WB` to the overall length `OL`, indicating vehicle stability and aerodynamics.\n","\n","- **Frontal Area (FA):** Calculated as `OW x OH`, directly impacting the vehicle's air resistance as it moves forward.\n","\n","- **Track Width Difference (TWD):** The absolute difference between front and rear track widths, indicating vehicle stability which might affect energy efficiency.\n","\n","- **Overhang Ratio Front (ORF)** and **Rear (ORR):** Calculated as `F1/WB` and `G1/WB` respectively, showing the proportion of the vehicle's overhang to its wheelbase, affecting aerodynamics and stability.\n","\n","- **Glass Height to Body Height Ratio (GHBHR):** `C1/OH`, indicating the proportion of the vehicle height made up by the side glass, which could influence aerodynamics.\n","\n","- **Underbody Clearance (UBC):** Represents the clearance under the vehicle, affecting aerodynamics at high speeds.\n","\n","- **Cabin Width to Vehicle Width Ratio (CWVWR):** `E1/OW`, showing how much of the vehicle's width is occupied by the cabin.\n","\n","- **Curb Weight to Volume Ratio (CWVR):** `CW/(OL x OW x OH)`, indicating how the vehicle's mass is distributed over its volume, which could impact energy efficiency.\n","\n","- **Total Overhang (TO):** Sum of front and rear overhangs (`F1 + G1`), potentially affecting vehicle dynamics and energy consumption.\n","\n","- **Average Track Width (ATW):** The average of the front and rear track widths, providing an overview of vehicle stability.\n","\n","- **Body to Wheelbase Ratio (BWR):** `(A1 + B1)/WB`, indicating the proportion of the vehicle's body length to its wheelbase, affecting dynamics.\n","\n","- **Curb Weight to Length Ratio (CWLR):** `CW/OL`, showing how weight is distributed relative to the vehicle's length.\n","\n","- **Frontal Aspect Ratio (FAR):** `OW/C1`, providing insights into the vehicle's aerodynamics by comparing its width to the height of its glass area.\n","\n","- **Weight Distribution Front to Rear Ratio (WDFR_RATIO):** A ratio indicating the balance of weight distribution between the front and rear of the vehicle.\n","\n","- **Combined Weight Distribution Impact (CW_WD_IMPACT):** Combines the weight distribution factors with the curb weight to assess the overall impact on vehicle dynamics and efficiency.\n"],"metadata":{"nteract":{"transient":{"deleting":false}}},"id":"ef7d1607-612e-465e-86a2-83c80991035a"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Drop unnecessary columns\n","df = df.drop(['MAKE_df1', 'MODEL_df1', 'YEAR_df1', 'Combined_Key_df1', 'DF2_Index', \n","              'MAKE_df2', 'MODEL_df2', 'MYR', 'FILE_YEAR', 'YEAR_df2', 'Combined_Key_df2'], axis=1)\n","\n","# Interpret 'WDIST' to extract Front and Rear weight distribution\n","df[['WDF', 'WDR']] = df['WDIST'].str.split('/', expand=True).astype(float)\n","\n","## Building new features \n","# Vehicle Volume\n","df['VV'] = df['OL'] * df['OW'] * df['OH']\n","# Surface Area\n","df['SA'] = 2 * (df['OL'] * df['OW'] + df['OL'] * df['OH'] + df['OW'] * df['OH'])\n","# Aspect Ratio: \n","df['AR'] = df['OW'] / df['OH']\n","# Wheelbase to Length Ratio: \n","df['WBLR'] = df['WB'] / df['OL']\n","# Frontal Area: \n","df['FA'] = df['OW'] * df['OH']\n","# Track Width Difference: \n","df['TWD'] = (df['TWF'] -
